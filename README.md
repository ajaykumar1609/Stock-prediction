# Stock Prediction using RNN and LSTM

This project aims to predict stock prices using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) models.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Usage

1. Clone the repository ---> git clone https://github.com/ajaykumar1609/stock-prediction.git
2. Install the required packages
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook ---> jupyter notebook stock_prediction.ipynb



## Files

- `stock_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for training and evaluating the RNN and LSTM models
- `data/`: Folder containing the stock data used for training and evaluation

## Results

The results of the trained RNN and LSTM models will be displayed in the Jupyter Notebook. The models are trained and evaluated on a set of historical stock data. The performance of the models is measured using Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
